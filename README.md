# Hangman-Game

This is a movie themed hangman game for the browser. It chooses randomly from an array of 20 movie titles to start the game.
The user selects a letter, which counts against the number of guesses and shows up in the letters guessed tracker.
Input validation is performed so that only letters are allowed and no duplicates show up in the letters guessed area.
Guessing the movie or running out of guesses will give a win or a loss, confirmed by sound and screen counters.
The game then resets and continues automatically until the user exits the browser.
